## Keep trying to manually generate until you succeed 
## Very large calculations are halted so you may need to try several times
## Otherwise you can use the automatic generator

## Now what do you do with these key pairs?
## They can be used to encrypt and decrypt data as follows: 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
